A service receives two types of requests managed by one server. A maximum of N1 and N2 requests for the two types of services respectively can be stored. The arrivals of both types of requests are described by Poisson processes with parameters lamda1 and lamda2 respectively. The server serves the requests with service rates mu1 (for the type one requests) and mu2 (for the type two requests). Customers arrive to the system when the chosen queue is full and are discarded.
Assuming the set of parameters in Table 1, compare the performances of the system at a steady state when the server chooses a request from the two queues randomly or based on priority to either one or the other queue. The performance metrics to evaluate are:
 ->system throughput,
 ->loss rate for both the two types of requests separately,
 ->server utilization,
 ->mean total number of requests in the system,
 ->mean number of waiting requests in both the queues.
 Parameter Value
N1 = 5
N2 = 11
1/lamda1 = 1 min
1/lamda2 = 2 min
1/mu1 = 0.5 min
1/mu2 = 1.5 min
