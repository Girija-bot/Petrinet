A service receives two types of requests managed by one server. A maximum of N1 and N2 requests for the two types of services respectively can be stored. The arrivals of both the types of requests are described by Poisson processes with parameter 1 and 2 respectively. The server serves the requests with service rates 1 (for the type one requests) and 2 (for the type two requests). Customers arrived to the system when the chosen queue is full are discarded.
Assuming the set of parameters in Table 1, compare the performances of the system at steady state when the server chooses a request from the two queues randomly or based on priority to either one or the other queue. The performance metrics to evaluate are:
 ->system throughput,
 ->loss rate for both the two type of requests separately,
 ->server utilization,
 ->mean total number of requests in the system,
 ->mean number of waiting requests in both the queues.
